import AuditLog from "../models/system/auditLog.js";

/*
 * Records who did what: every mutating request (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) made
 * by a logged-in user gets one AuditLog entry, written fire-and-forget on
 * res.on("finish") so it never adds latency to the actual response and a
 * logging failure can never break the real request.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT log GET requests (page views) — at this app's route
 * count that would be extremely high volume for very little audit value.
 * LOGIN/LOGOUT are logged explicitly at their own call sites in server.js
 * instead of here, since req.session.authUser isn't in a meaningful state
 * around those requests.
 *
 * Description (the human-readable "what happened") is resolved in three
 * tiers, richest first:
 *   1. res.locals.auditDescription — set by the route handler itself, which
 *      has full context (e.g. `Created client "NAYASA SUPERPLAST"`, or for
 *      deletes, the entity's name looked up *before* it was removed).
 *   2. A generic guess from a small allowlist of common identifying body
 *      fields (clientName, productId, poNumber, ...) — covers routes that
 *      haven't been individually instrumented yet.
 *   3. Bare "<ACTION> <path>" — last-resort fallback.
 * Only the allowlisted fields below are ever read from req.body; nothing
 * else (so passwords/tokens/free-text fields never end up in the log).
